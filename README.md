## Problem Statement
There are more than 100 road signs and all of them have there own significance. Even though all of these road signs are not encoutered in the daily life these should be understood by the driver. Despite having seen them in many occasions several drivers fail to notice or recognise few signs. This might result in dangerous driving conditions and create a bad environment for travellers that use the road.

## About the project
We developed a Deep Learning model that can identify the road sign and instruct the driver to act accordingly. The driver will be more conscious and can act accordingly creating a safer environment.

## Technical Implementation
- Identify the Road Sign
- Find the Significance of the Road Sign
- Speak it Out to the Driver
  
## Techstacks Used 
`Convolution Neural Networks` `pyttsx3` `Tensorflow` `matplotlib`
## How to run locally
+ Download the files
+ Install required libraries and dependencies
+ Change the file paths in the notebook
+ run the notebook
  
# What's next?
+ Multilingual Speech can be added.
+ The model requires more training using images in night and climatic conditions such as rain and fog that reduce the vision.
+ We can use pre-trained models and finetune to improve the accuracy of the model.
+ Should be integrated with YOLO to be able to perform real time recognition.
